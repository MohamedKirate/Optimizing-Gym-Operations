# Gym Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes data from a chain of gyms, focusing on member check-ins, workout types, calories burned, and gym locations. The goal is to gain insights into member behavior, popular workout routines, and gym usage patterns.

## Data

The analysis uses the following datasets:
- **checkin_checkout_history_updated.csv**: Records of check-in and checkout times, workout types, and calories burned for each gym visit.
- **gym_locations_data.csv**: Details about gym locations.
- **subscription_plans.csv**: Information on available gym membership plans.
- **users_data.csv**: Information about registered gym members.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization

You can install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Data Loading**: The notebook loads all datasets for analysis.
2. **Data Exploration**: Initial steps involve understanding the data structure and contents through summary statistics and sample records.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Tracking member check-in and checkout times.
   - Analyzing workout preferences across gyms.
   - Calculating total calories burned across different workouts.

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in sequence.

## Results

This analysis provides insights into:
- Peak gym hours and popular gym locations.
- Common workout types and average calories burned.
- User behavior trends based on gym activity data.
